# GameBoy ROM Tutorial

Howdy y'all,

This is a quick little tutorial on mask ROM recovery, in which we'll
begin with photographs of the mask ROM from Nintendo's GameBoy and end
up with a ROM file that can be disassembled or emulated.

The GameBoy is a good target for this because it uses what's called a
Via ROM, meaning that metal Vias between layers encode the individual
bits and those bits can be read from the surface of the chip.  The ROM
is also small enough that I can include it in a Github repository and
that you won't spend weeks working out minor bit errors.

Cheers from Knoxville,

--Travis Goodspeed

## Photography

We'll begin with `dmg01cpurom.bmp`, which I photographed in my home
lab after decapsulating a chip in HNO3 and cleaning it in an
ultrasonic bath of acetone.  This chip does not require delayering
with hydrofluoric acid or bit staining with a Dash Etch solution of
HNO3, HF, and acetic acid.

The photo was produced in my metallurgical microscope as twenty-two
frames under 50x magnification, which were then stitched together in
Hugin.  A biological microscope will not work, because the silicon
substrate is opaqe to visible light; in a metallurgical microscope,
the light reflects off of the sample rather than transmitting through
it.

My original photo was too large for Github, so the version that you
will work with is reduced in resolution.  Lossy compression is avoided
because it can confuse the image recognition.

If you produce your own photo of the DMG-01-CPU chip, the instructions
here will work just as well.

## Bit Extraction

In this tutorial, we'll be extracting the bits with
[MaskRomTool](https://github.com/travisgoodspeed/maskromtool/), a CAD
program of mine for rapid bit extraction.

Begin by compiling MaskRomTool and installing it.  If you are
comfortable with the unix command-line, you will want the executables
`maskromtool` and `gatorom` to be in your `$PATH`.  If not, don't
worry about that part, as all the features are also available from the
GUI.

On Windows and macOS, you can avoid compiling the code by using a
[prebuilt
release](https://github.com/travisgoodspeed/maskromtool/releases).
These are compiled every few months when the code feels particularly
stable.

After you have it running, use MaskRomTool to open `dmg01cpurom.bmp`.

![First Opening of the Image](screenshots/10-firstopen.png)

Notice how a grey crosshair follows your mouse.  They begin straight,
but will soon tilt to match the row and column lines that you place on
the ROM.  This allows you to predict where repeated rows and columns of the same
angle will fall, as most images are tilted but most bits are in
perfect lines.

Notice also that the bits in the ROM come in pairs of regular rows and
groups of eight regular columns.  In MaskRomTool, you'll be placing
rows and columns, but there are no strict limits about matching the
grouping of the original image.  If you find that you can reliably
place a massive row that crosses the entire width of the image, or a
massive column that crosses the entire height of the image, feel free
to do so.  If the image is crooked and you need a very short line to
work around an error, that's also fine.

### Navigation

To move around the image, you will use either your mouse or your
laptop's trackpad.  Mice are preferred because right clicking is a
little easier.

Drag the background with the middle mouse button to scroll a little
bit, or use two fingers on the trackpad to pan around the screen.  If
you hold the shift key, this panning will be much faster.

Zoom is very important for these projects.  The `QAZ` keys handle
zooming, with `Q` snapping to native resolution, `A` and `Z` zooming
in and out.  On a mouse, holding `ctrl` and spinning the scroll wheel
will also adjust the zoom.  With a trackpad, you might pinch to zoom,
but only if your operating system supports it.

Spend a moment moving around the ROM photograph, guessing at what
different structures are.  After that, we'll start marking up the
image.

### Placing Rows

We'll begin with a few short rows and try long ones later.  First,
click a little to the left of the leftmost bit, and then move your
mouse to the right but do **NOT** click.  Instead press the `R` key to
place a Row.  A thin black line will appear between those two points.

You could repeat this to place all of the rows, but that would be
labor intensive and might involve a lot of scrolling for very long
ones.  Instead, keep your mouse on the right side but move it down a
little.  When your crosshair lines up with the row, press the spacebar
to drop another row with the same length and angle.

Repeating this across many rows should mark them out in short order.
In the following screenshot, I've marked short segments of the first
eight rows.

Once you get the hang of marking repeated rows from only their
right-hand side, you might as well mark them across the entire image
to save time and effort.  If straight lines can't cross the entire
image, then mark shorter lengths or better align your panorama of
photographs.

If you place a row in the wrong position, there are ways to move it.
First drag a box with the left mouse button to select one or more
lines, then drag with the right mouse button to move them.  The arrow
keys will also move a selection, and the `S` key will set the position
of a single line to a new end point.

![Eight short rows marked in the ROM.](screenshots/20-firstrows.png)

### Placing Columns

While you've marked some rows, the software still doesn't know
where your bits are because you haven't yet marked any columns.

To mark you first column, first click above the bit in your first
column.  Then, as with a row, move your mouse beneath the last bit of
the column and hit `C` to place a column line.  (Do **NOT** click
a second time.)

Repeat this by moving your mouse beneath the other last bits and
pressing the spacebar.  As each column line is dropped across the row
lines, blue squares will appear over each bit.  The software now knows
where the bits are, and in the next step we'll teach it to know the
difference between a one and a zero.

Please double-check that bits are in reasonable positions.  If any of
the bit boxes are not directly over the bit, select the offending row
or column and drag with the right mouse button to correct its
position.  If the angle is wrong, use `D` to erase the line and then
draw a fresh one.

![First bits are now recognized.](screenshots/30-firstbits.png)

### Recognizing Bits

To identify bits, the software needs not just the bit positions that
you've provided, but also a threshold and color channel to distinguish
the bits.  Click Edit and then Choose Bit Threshold to see the
following graph and choose your own threshold.

![Histogram of the first 64 bits.](screenshots/40-histogram.png)

This histogram of the first 64 bits shows gaps in all three color
channels.  The largest gap is in the Green channel, so I would set the
threshold to 172 in that channel.  Notice how the bit boxes
automatically adjust themselves as you change the threshold.

Although the Blue and Red channels could work for this image, we want
the Green channel because it has the *largest* gap.  When we start
adding up all of the bits in the image, the larger color distances
will ensure that we get fewer bit errors.

![Another histogram of the first 64 bits.](screenshots/50-histogram2.png)

Once you've set the first sixty-four bits, click View and ASCII
Preview to see them.  Ain't that nifty?

```
11101011
01111111
00110111
01101111
10110001
01101110
01011100
10110101
```

### More Bits

Now that you've got a taste of recognizing sixty four bits, let's
recognize all of them.

First, wipe our your previous work by either deleting
`dmg01cpurom.bmp.json` and opening `dmg01cpurom.bmp` in a fresh
instance of Mask ROM Tool or bulk erase your lines.  Bulk erasure is
performed by drag-selecting lines and then pressing `D` to cut them
out.

(Strictly speaking, you could also mark the image with many very small
rows and columns.  The only reason I recommend against that is that
it takes forever.)

After erasing the lines, drop a row that goes from the far left of the
screen to the far right.  If you are starting over instead of deleting
prior work, it sometimes helps to first draw a shorter row so that the
angle of the cross-hairs will be tilted the same as the image.  You
can draw an attempt at a row with `R` and then delete it with `D`,
without the software forgetting about your first starting position.

After getting the first line drawn, move your mouse down the right
side of the photograph, hitting the space bar whenever you
pass a row to drop a line.  If you find that you marked the bit just a
little off, you can use the `S` key to Set the position of the last
line, moving it to the new mouse location.  Arrow keys and dragging
with a right click will also reposition it, with bit values changing
along with the positions.

If the rows are particularly regular, you might place several at time.
To do this, select some with the left mouse button and then press
`Shift+D` to duplicate the collection.  The lines can then be moved to
the new position with the right click drag, while a duplicate copy
will remain at the original position.

After drawing the long rows, draw the columns.  Just click once above
the first bit to set a start point, then hit `C` beneath the last bit
to draw a column.  The spacebar will drop a new column of the same angle
at another end point, so you can step through the image and draw all
of the columns in short order.

![All bits have been marked.](screenshots/60-allbits.png)

When all the bits have been set, use Edit / Choose Bit Threshold to
adjust the threshold a bit.  Notice how the curve is a lot smoother
with so many more bits, and that 151 might be a better choice than
172.

![Smoother histogram.](screenshots/61-newhistogram.png)

### Finding and Fixing Mistakes

It's a great feeling to have all the bits marked, but that's rarely
the end of it.  Before continuing on to decoding the ROM, it's a good
idea to do some quick sanity checks and make sure that no mistakes
were made.

The `V` key or DRC / Evaluate Rules to run some quick sanity checks
over your design.  For example, what if you placed a line wrong and
the color of a bit was suspiciously close to the threshold?  You might
get a DRC error like this one, which you could resolve by correcting
the line placement.  Each Design Rule Check (DRC) violation has a
position and appears as a yellow box in the GUI.  The `E` key will
jump to the next error position in the list.

![A poorly placed column made a bit
ambigious.](screenshots/70-ambiguous.png)

While mistakes like a misplaced line are your fault, those mistakes
which are not your fault must also be corrected.  Sometimes a bit of
dust sneaks into the photograph, obscuring a bit's value at the sample
location.  Sometimes a chemistry error makes the bit a little hard to
see.

In situations like this, where you know better than the machine, press
`Shift+F` with your mouse over the bit to Force its value and place a
little green box around the bit.  If the wrong value is applied,
pressing `Shift+F` again will flip it.

![Forcing a bit to its proper value.](screenshots/71-force.png)

After all of this, the bits are finally complete!

## About the CLI

So far, we've been using this tool in the GUI, but when you get to
larger projects you'll want to automate some things with the CLI.  By
default it launches the GUI, so you'll want to add `-platform
offscreen -e` when running it standalone, to both avoid opening
windows and to exit on completion.

```

```

Supposing that we have the ROM as `dmg01cpurom.bmp` and its matching
`.json` file, we can export the bits from the CLI like this in macOS
or Linux.  In Windows, we call `maskromtoolcli.exe` instead of
`maskromtool` so that the console connection is maintained.

```

## Decoding a ROM File

You now have the bits of your project in physical order, but this is
quite different from the logically ordered bytes that a disassembler
or emulator would prefer.  We'll first do this graphically, and then
also see how to do it from the Unix command line.

Previous versions of this guide suggested installing MAME's `unidasm`
disassembler or [Radare2](https://rada.re).  Those still work, but
[GoodASM](https://github.com/travisgoodspeed/goodasm) is now included
in MaskRomTool and works just fine for the GameBoy's SM83
architecture.

### Decoding Graphically

You can play around with decoding settings manually with
Edit/Decoding.  Begin by setting the disassembly architecture to
`goodasm/sm83` and the wordsize to `8`.  The flips, rotation, and banking
will be solved for you in a bit, and the list of flags at the bottom
shows you the options that would be passed to
[GatoROM](https://github.com/travisgoodspeed/maskromtool/blob/master/GATOREADME.md)
for decoding on the command line.

![Graphical solution](screenshots/decoder.png)

You can solve for particular byte sequences or Yara rules with
View/Solver.  Double-clicking a solution will reconfigure the decoder
and update the hex and disassembly views, so that they can be quickly
searched.

Begin by using the Bytes tap of the Solver to solve for `0:31`, which
means that the first three bytes will be `31`.  This is the SM83
machine code for setting the stack pointer, and it results in three
potential decodings.  Double clicking on a solution will apply those
settings to the decoder, updating the other views to match.

![Graphical solution](screenshots/solver.png)

View/HexPreview will show the decoding live in hexadecimal.  After
selecting some bytes, you can also highlight them with
View/HighlightHexSelection to see where those bits are located in your
project file.

![Screenshot of highlighted bytes in the GameBoy view.](screenshots/hexview.png)


View/Disassembly will show the disassembled code, using the built-in
GoodASM disassembler or external calls to Radare2 or Unidasm.  Jumping
between the three solutions you have in your Solutions window, you'll
find that `--decode-cols-downr -i -r 0 --flipx` decodes the first
instruction to `ld sp, #0xfffe`.  That sets the stack pointer to the
top of internal RAM, indicating that it's the correct decoding.

![Screenshot of disassembly.](screenshots/goodasm.png)


### Decoding with GatoROM

[GatoROM](https://github.com/travisgoodspeed/maskromtool/blob/master/GATOREADME.md)
is a bit decoder that ships with MaskRomTool.  It runs from the
command line, but under the hood it is powered by the same libraries
that run in the GUI solver.

First we need an ASCII file of the ROM bits.  You can generate this
with File / Export / ASCII in MaskRomTool's GUI or from the CLI with
`maskromtool -platform offscreen dmg01cpurom.bmp -a DMG_ROM.txt -e`.

Here's how to solve for the ROM knowing that the first two bytes are
`31` and `fe`.  The `-z` flag tells it that we want
[Zorrom](https://github.com/JohnDMcMaster/zorrom) compatibility mode,
and it accurately identifies three potential decodings before writing
the correct one to `DMG_ROM.bin`.

```
dell% gatorom DMG_ROM.txt --solve --solve-bytes "0:31,1:fe" -z -o DMG_ROM.bin
Grade 50        31 11 47 fe 3e f9 1e 0e         -z --decode-cols-left -i -r 180 --flipx 
Grade 50        8a fe a8 01 d4 52 b0 a4         -z --decode-squeeze-lr -r 180 --flipx 
Grade 100       31 fe ff af 21 ff 9f 32         -z --decode-cols-downr -i -r 180 --flipx 
Exporting       -z --decode-cols-downr -i -r 180 --flipx 
dell% 
```

We can also search in other ways.  What if we know that `31 fe ff`
exists somewhere in the image, but we don't know exactly where?  This
yields three potential solutions, and we can explore the different
ones if needed by dumping them to files.

```
dell% gatorom DMG_ROM.txt --solve --solve-string "31,fe,ff" 
Grade 100       f5 06 19 78 86 23 05 20         --decode-cols-downl -i -r 0 --flipx 
Grade 100       31 fe ff af 21 ff 9f 32         --decode-cols-downr -i -r 0 --flipx 
Grade 100       f5 06 19 78 86 23 05 20         --decode-cols-downl-swap -i -r 0 --flipx 
dell% 
```

### Loading the hex bytes into radare2

In order to view the disassembly of the hex representation of the
extracted bits in [radare2](http://github.com/radareorg/radare2), you
can use the following:

```
; r2 malloc://256               # open radare2 with 256 bytes of memory available
[0x00000000]> e asm.arch=gb     # set the gameboy architecture
[0x00000000]> e asm.bits=8      # set the bits to 8
[0x00000000]> wxf hex.txt       # load the hex file into memory starting at 0x0
[0x00000000]> pD 0xff           # print 0xff bytes of disassembly
```
